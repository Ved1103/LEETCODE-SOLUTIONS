## Introduction

Coding interviews can be challenging, and practicing with real interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare. This repository is aimed at helping you ace your coding interview by providing you with a comprehensive collection of solutions to LeetCode problems in C++. Each solution includes a detailed explanation of the approach and the thought process behind it.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem categories and difficulty levels:
```bash
LeetCode-Solutions
│
├── Problem1
│ ├── problem.cpp
│ └── README.md
│
├── Problem2
│ ├── problem.cpp
│ └── README.md
│
├── Problem3
│ ├── problem.cpp
│ └── README.md
│
└── ...
```

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LeetCode-Solutions.git
   cd LeetCode-Solutions
2. **Browse Solutions**

   Navigate to the folder of the problem you're interested in. Each folder is named according to the problem's title or identifier.
3. **Run Solutions**

   Each solution file (problem.cpp) contains code that can be run directly on the LeetCode platform. These files cannot be compiled and run locally as they are meant to be executed within the LeetCode environment.

4. **Understand the Question**

   Each problem folder includes a README.md file with question explanation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution to a LeetCode problem that is not already in the repository, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the repository's structure.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new solution'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
